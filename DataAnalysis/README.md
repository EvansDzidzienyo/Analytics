# Celebrity Insights Analysis Project

## Overview
The Celebrity Insights Analysis project is a data-driven exploration of the entertainment industry, focusing on key metrics associated with famous celebrities, including their success across genres, revenue generation, and award achievements. This project uses a **snowflake schema** to organize and manage data on celebrities across eight tables in SQL, and leverages **Power BI** for insightful visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that answer questions such as:
- Which genre is the most popular?
- Who is the most successful artist based on revenue and awards?
- Which profession (Actor, Singer, or Both) receives the most awards?
- Which artist and region generate the most revenue?

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are to:
1. **Identify the Most Patronized Genre**: Determine which genre has the highest level of patronage.
2. **Determine the Most Successful Artist**: Analyze awards and revenue to find the top-performing artist.
3. **Assess Awards by Profession**: Calculate total awards based on profession, focusing on Actors, Singers, or those who are both.
4. **Find the Top Revenue-Generating Artist**: Identify the artist with the highest revenue.
5. **Determine the Region with the Most Revenue**: Analyze revenue distribution by region to see which area is the most lucrative.

## Project Components
This project comprises several key components, each designed to facilitate a structured and comprehensive analysis:

### 1. **Database Schema**
   - A **snowflake schema** was designed in SQL to handle and organize the celebrity data effectively. The schema comprises eight tables:
      - **Artists**: Contains information on individual celebrities, including name, profession, and genres associated.
      - **Genres**: Lists the genres and links them to respective artists.
      - **Awards**: Records awards won by each artist, detailing award names and categories.
      - **Revenue**: Captures revenue generated by each artist, region, and year.
      - Additional tables provide supporting information to maintain a normalized schema and ensure data integrity.

### 2. **SQL Queries**
   - Several **SQL queries** were developed to extract insights from the database, answering the main questions posed by the project:
      - **Most Patronized Genre**: A query that counts and ranks genres based on patronage.
      - **Top Revenue-Generating Artist**: A query that calculates and ranks artists by total revenue.
      - **Awards by Profession**: A query that tallies awards according to artist professions.
      - **Revenue by Region**: An analysis of revenue distribution across different regions.

### 3. **Data Export and Power BI Visualizations**
   - After querying the database, the tables were exported in Excel format to facilitate further analysis.
   - The data was then uploaded to **Power BI**, where interactive dashboards and visualizations were created to bring insights to life:
      - **Genre Popularity Dashboard**: A visualization depicting the most patronized genres among fans.
      - **Revenue Distribution**: Bar and column charts showing top-earning artists and revenue by region.
      - **Awards by Profession**: Pie charts and tables that show the distribution of awards among Actors, Singers, and those with both professions.
      - **Top Success Metrics**: Combined visualizations that showcase total revenue and awards to identify the most successful artists.

## How to Use This Project
To explore the visualizations and data insights:

1. **Download** the Power BI file (`.pbix`) and SQL queries from this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` file with [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) to interact with the visualizations.
3. Use the filters and interactive features to explore different metrics, such as genre popularity, artist revenue, awards distribution, and region-based revenue generation.

## Insights and Findings
The analysis provided several key insights:
- **Genre Popularity**: The project reveals which genres have the highest fan engagement and patronage.
- **Top Earning Artist**: By comparing revenue and awards, the project identifies the highest-earning and most awarded artists.
- **Regional Revenue Trends**: The regional analysis shows which areas are the most lucrative for celebrities, highlighting where the industry is most financially rewarding.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured data storage in SQL, combined with visual analytics in Power BI, can yield actionable insights in the entertainment industry. These findings can be valuable for stakeholders looking to understand trends in celebrity success, genre popularity, and revenue distribution.

## Future Scope
Future improvements could include:
- Incorporating additional data, such as social media influence, to gauge popularity further.
- Adding historical trends over longer periods for time-series analysis.
- Using machine learning techniques to predict future success metrics based on current data.
